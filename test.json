You'll have the comforts of cruising. These big ships may be regulated soon. Smaller ships will often let you get right onto land. Costs start at least $5k (for the ultra cheap).</p><p><strong>Tailored Expeditions:</strong>Many companies run specialty expeditions which let you visit Antarctica exactly how you want. Prices are extremely high for this.</p><p><strong>Airborne:</strong>You get to fly over Antarctica. This is the more ecological way to see it but doesn't have the same experience as actually walking on it. This is also the cheapest option.</p>",
